## Problem
**Too maney buses...which one is mine?** 
With seven bus lines serving the same stop
riders need a tool that letâ€™s them know if/when their bus is arriving.


## Solution

**Data that is easy to access and read.** 
An app that provides riders quick and easy access to what the next arriving bus is, and how much time they have to get to the bus stop. Present the information in a clear way that lets the user interpret it within few seconds.
